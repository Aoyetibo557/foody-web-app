how the cart works: im using sessionId to create adocument in firebase to hold the selected items;
a function creates a session id if there isn't any and add's it to the sessionCart collection in firebase.

--in Cart.js:
i'm using a function to get the ids saved in the sessionCart documents, then passing it to CartCard to retrieve the object before displaying it

:Note/Tasks to accomplish:[
    - Tryfixing the session creation function to be a little longer.
    - After tab is closed destroy session, and remove session from the database
    - after payment clear sessionCart of the session just payed. ergo: destroy session
    - make sure the orders collection is updated after every order:
    - create the function that will connect to the orders collection fron checkpoint 

    --- create checkpoint page / componenet

:Micelaneous tasks: [
    - mobile responsoveness needs to be fixed for both cart and shop
    - the button/ links on both page need to be active/ functioning
    - the category bar needs to be responsive in grid formart
